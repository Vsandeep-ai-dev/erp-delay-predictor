# ERP Delay Predictor

A machine learning-based Streamlit application that predicts potential delays in ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) shipment or inventory orders. It helps businesses forecast disruptions and take preemptive action to optimize supply chain efficiency.

## 🔍 Features

- Upload ERP orders as a CSV file
- Predict delay likelihood using trained ML model
- Simple Streamlit interface for easy access
- Built with Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit
